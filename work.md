## Project List

| # | Project Title | Tools | Summary | Code |
|---|---------------|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | Lung Cancer Prediction | Python, scikit-learn, Jupyter | Built classification models to predict lung cancer status using clinical and lifestyle features. Compared multiple algorithms and evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. | [View Code](https://github.com/ArminHeldo/ArminHeldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Lung%20cancer%20Final%20Project%20Paper%20DSC%20630.docx) |
| 2 | Heart Disease Risk Analysis | Python, pandas, matplotlib | Cleaned and analyzed a heart disease dataset to identify key risk factors. Created visualizations to compare patients with and without disease and evaluated model performance. | [View Code](https://github.com/ArminHeldo/ArminHeldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Milestone3_Presentation.pptx) |
| 3 | Credit Card Fraud Detection | Python, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn | Worked with a highly imbalanced fraud dataset. Used resampling techniques and focused on recall to reduce false negatives. Compared models and discussed tradeoffs between precision and recall. | [View Code](https://github.com/ArminHeldo/ArminHeldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/CreditCard_Fraud_Presentation.pptx) |
| 4 | Childcare Prices & Affordability | Python / Power BI | Analyzed childcare pricing data to explore cost patterns by state, age group, and type of care. Built visuals that highlight affordability challenges for families. | [View Code](https://github.com/ArminHeldo/ArminHeldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Childcare%20pricing%20analysis.pdf) |
| 5 | Netflix Top 10 Visual Storytelling | Power BI, Data Visualization | Combined multiple Netflix datasets to explore what titles reach the Top 10 and why. Created a dashboard and summary report connecting viewer behavior with content trends and ethical considerations. | [View Code](https://github.com/ArminHeldo/ArminHeldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Netflix%20top%2010%20analysis.docx) |
| 6 | FIFA Pro Soccer Players | Python, pandas, matplotlib | Cleaned and analyzed FIFA soccer players data to identify players by age and teams they play for. Created visualizations that show trends by age and the top player's nationalities. | [View Code](https://github.com/ArminHeldo/ArminHeldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Fifa%20pro%20soccer%20players.pdf) |
| 7 | White House Visits | Python, time series | Investigated how many visits per day were at the White House and the demographic of the visitors. | [View Code](https://github.com/ArminHeldo/ArminHeldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/White%20house%20visits.pdf) |
| 8 | Historical Stock Price Patterns | Python, pandas, matplotlib | Pulled and analyzed historical stock data to explore volatility, trends, and moving averages. Built visualizations and simple forecasting approaches. | [View Code]( |
| 9 | Kia and Hyundai Thefts | Python | Explored a dataset to understand how many car thefts were going on and specifically which car makes were being targeted. | [View Code](https://github.com/ArminHeldo/ArminHeldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Kia%20and%20Hyundai%20thefts%20presentation.pdf) |
|10 | Housing Affordability | Python, scikit-learn | Used Zillow data to build predictive models related to prices of housing to determine affordability. Focused on model evaluation and interpretation. | [View Code](https://github.com/ArminHeldo/ArminHeldo.github.io/blob/main/assets/Housing%20affordability.pdf) |

## How This Repository Is Organized

- Each project has its own folder with:
  - Raw and/or cleaned data (if allowed to share)
  - A Jupyter Notebook or script with working code
  - A brief `README.md` describing the goal, methods, and key results

You can always return to the main repository home from any page:
