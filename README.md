# Data Science Projects 

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository.  
Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using data cleaning, visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning workflows.
The main goal of this repository is to showcase the projects that I created and showcase my skills and insights. Each project includes a README file that summarizes the project and the skills I used.
